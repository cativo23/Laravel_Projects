## About

This is a very early version of a system for a travel agency, I can't display the latest version due security and privacy reasons. This version contains some errors, bugs and the code is messy and incomplete, but it contains the basis for all the further development, which basically consisted of improving the quality of the code, improving performance and adding a few new features.

### Features:

 - Register new users
 - Login and Logout
 - Recover Password
 - Verify Email
 - Notification to the administrator that a new user has registered, so that he can approve their entry to the system.
 - CRUD of Destinations, Activities, Points of interes, etc.
 - Site Builder (up and down a website)
 - Images and video upload to S3
 - User approval by Admin.
 - IP based redirection (Check Booking Controller)

### Disclaimer
I had to replace the names to avoid any problems, so certain things may not work as they should.
